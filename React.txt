1. key features of react
    - it supports jsx
    - react is component based architecture
    - use virtual DOM for fast rendering
    - only focused on one way data flow with reusable UI components(parent to child)
    - react hooks
2. How reacts solve the problems
    - react solve the problems of building dynamic, complex and interactive UIs efficiently
    - react's virtual DOM and component system makes UI updates faster and more organised
3. react is a framework or library
    - react is a javascript library because it only focus on building UIs
    - it manages only the view layer
    - helps to manage how data is displayed on the screen
4. how react makes easier to make UIs
    - react breaks UI into reusable components
    - use virtual DOM to manage and update UIs
    - each component has its own logic and structure
    - only focused on one way data flow with reusable UI components
    - No need to manually manipulate the DOM
5.Steps to set up a basic React development environment
    -Install Node.js and npm – Required to run React and manage dependencies.
    -Install a code editor – Commonly Visual Studio Code.
    -Create a new React app – Run npx create-react-app my-app.
    -Navigate to your app folder – Use cd my-app.
    -Start the development server – Run npm start.
6.Files & Folder Structure of react app using vite
    - vite.config.js : vite configuaration file for react app
    - README.md : project documentation file
    - package.json :  configuaration file for project 
    - package-lock.json : details version of packages installed in project
    - .gitignore : used to mention files or folders to be ignored in git 
    - eslint.config.js : configuaration file for js code quality check 
    - index.html : entry point of app 
    - node_modules folder : holding copies of packages installed in the project, so that project can use package from node_modules instead of internet, inorder  to create node_modules in a project using command : npm install
    - public folder : used to hold items that can accessed from any where in the project 
    - src folder : is the folder where react app logic is given
        - main.jsx : used to display react app in browser
            - createRoot() : create a root to display React components inside a browser DOM node.
     - index.css : global css file
    - App.jsx : is a component file, which is the root component of react app
    - App.css : css file for App.jsx
    - asset folder : used to hold image, video... of a project
3. How to start the development server and view your React app
    -Open the terminal in your React project folder.
    -Type npm start and press Enter.
    -The development server will start automatically.
    -Your browser opens automatically at http://localhost:3000/
    showing your React app.
4. Common code editors or IDEs for React development
    -Visual Studio Code (VS Code)
    -WebStorm
    -Sublime Text
    -Atom
    -Brackets
    (VS Code is the most popular because it supports React extensions and debugging easily.)
5. What is Babel and why it’s used in React
    -Babel is a JavaScript compiler.
    -It converts modern ES6+ code and JSX (React syntax) into plain JavaScript that browsers can understand.
    -Helps React developers use the latest JS features safely.
    -Ensures cross-browser compatibility.
    -Works with tools like Webpack for building and bundling code.
